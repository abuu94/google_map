Leaflet doesn’t even contain a single provider-specific line of code, 
so you’re free to use other providers if you need to (we’d suggest Mapbox though, it looks beautiful).

Whenever using anything based on OpenStreetMap, an attribution is obligatory as per the copyright notice.
Most other tile providers (such as Mapbox, Stamen or Thunderforest) require an attribution as well. 
Make sure to give credit where credit is due.

Working with markers:

var marker = L.marker([51.5, -0.09]).addTo(mymap);

this above line will insert marker without popup on the map.

var circle = L.circle([51.508, -0.11], {
    color: 'red',
    fillColor: '#f03',
    fillOpacity: 0.5,
    radius: 500
}).addTo(mymap);

this above code add a red circle in the map. independent from the marker above.

var polygon = L.polygon([
    [51.509, -0.08],
    [51.503, -0.06],
    [51.51, -0.047]
]).addTo(mymap);


this above will add pplygon in the map. when you add polygon you specify several points so as to draw polygon.

As my project it is better to use popup marker.
Popups are usually used when you want to attach some information to a particular object on a map. 
Leaflet has a very handy shortcut for this:

marker.bindPopup("<b>Hello world!</b><br>I am a popup.").openPopup();
circle.bindPopup("I am a circle.");
polygon.bindPopup("I am a polygon.");

I have to find how to disable popup until clicked. therefore it seem that there is a need to find or create onclick event/listener.
